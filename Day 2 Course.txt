Day 2 Course

programming is about problem solving, data manipulation, algorithm, input and output

How to do problem solving
Break it down into smaller pieces

identify the problem
indentify the goal

Analyze the problems

bits and bytes  = bit is the smallest unit of data stored in a pc memory
1 bit is stored in 0 and 1 - This is stored using transistors  on the hardware
 switch 1= on , 0=  off

 1000 = 8(binary) 
 to caclulate by using index postion   raise to power * number

 ASCII
 a,b,c,d,e mapped numbers to letters

 A= 65 a = 97
 HI! = 72 73 33

 it broken into 8 blocks ranging from 128 -1

 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 => 0 - 7

100111011000011100001

Hexadecimals

0-9, A-H;
F= 15 in decimal

220 in base 10 

8F= 143(base16)=> to binary = 10001111

decimal -10 base
binary - base 2
hex = 16 base
